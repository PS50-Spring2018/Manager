# in Sublime press ctrl + shift + P (linux command in ST for 'goto anything').
# Type in 'install',
# click on 'sublime package control: install package'.
# Then select SublimeREPL. It will install it automatically.
# To use it go to Tools>sublimerepl>python>python-RUNcurrentfile - this will run the script in a new tab, but with user input
