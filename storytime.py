Once upon a time, there was a dragon.  Her name was Hannah.  The dragon was very small, but very fierce.  
She wanted to become a scuba diver, but unfortunately her fire did not mesh well with the ocean #yikes. 
Hannah decided that she would have to build a custom scuba suit, lined with python skin, but that didn't turn out that well.
Unfortunately, pythons are not particularly tractable when one is a small dragon.  
Hannah flamed with frustration and then started doing research.

She instead decided to learn to code. She heard of this class called PS51 at Yale University.
Maybe that was where she could learn to bend python to her will?

It quickly became clear that the skins involved in python coding couldn't be used to line a scuba suit, but Hannah didn't care.
She had more immediate problems.  Coding was great, but typing with talons was very v e r y slow.

She got super excited! Apparently there were these great TA's named Tannah and Him. They always promised pizza in 
class on Friday but somehow always forgot to bring it. However, their teaching abilities were on fleek and in no 
time Hannah was up and coding in her dragonly ways.

This is Hannah, thank you. small change. change
