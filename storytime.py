Once upon a time, there was a dragon.  Her name was Hannah.  The dragon was very small, but very fierce.  
She wanted to become a scuba diver, but unfortunately her fire did not mesh well with the ocean #yikes. 
Hannah decided that she would have to build a custom scuba suit, lined with python skin, but that didn't turn out that well.
Unfortunately, pythons are not particularly tractable when one is a small dragon.  Hannah flamed with frustration and then started doing research.

She instead decided to learn to code. She heard of this class called PS51 at Yale University.
Maybe that was where she could learn to bend python to her will?
